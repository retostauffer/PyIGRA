READING IGRA2 DATA SETS
=======================

Small demo script on how to read IGRA2 data sets.
Currently only console output, no further data
processing. The data are from:
- a/data/igra2-data-format.txt

There is a list containing all stations and corresponding
file name of the archive files.
- http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/igra/data/data-por/

Description file of the data can be found here:
- http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/igra/data/igra2-data-format.txt

It would be very easy to download ALL zip files and extract the
data automatically but not yet coded.
